Network Basics Course Project
Overview
This project is a culmination of concepts and skills learned during the Network Basics course. It covers fundamental networking topics, including IP addressing, subnetting, routing protocols, and network topology design. This README provides a brief overview of the projectâ€™s objectives, the tools used, and the structure of the project files.

Objectives
Understand and apply basic networking concepts.
Configure and troubleshoot simple network topologies.
Gain hands-on experience with routing protocols like RIP and OSPF.
Develop skills in IP addressing and subnetting.
Tools and Technologies
Cisco Packet Tracer: For simulating and visualizing network topologies.
Command Line Interface (CLI): For configuring routers and switches.
GitHub: For version control and project documentation.
Project Structure
The project consists of multiple files, including configuration scripts, topology diagrams, and documentation. Below is a breakdown of the files:

Diagrams/: Contains network topology diagrams created during the course.
Configurations/: Holds configuration files for different routing protocols.
Documentation/: Contains detailed descriptions of each lab exercise and troubleshooting steps.
README.md: This README file.
Key Concepts Covered
IP Addressing and Subnetting: Dividing networks into sub-networks and assigning IP addresses.
Routing Protocols:
RIP (Routing Information Protocol): A distance-vector routing protocol.
OSPF (Open Shortest Path First): A link-state routing protocol.
Network Topology Design: Setting up simple network topologies and understanding their structure.
Troubleshooting: Basic troubleshooting techniques for network issues.
Getting Started
Install Cisco Packet Tracer to open and simulate the topologies.
